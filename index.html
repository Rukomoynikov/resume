				<h2>Current goal</h2>
				<p><b>I'd like to understand how UI Design works.</b> Several reasons are here. First of all is my pet projects, i want to make them usable and tasty visually. Second reason is UI design greatly improves my underastanding of frontend side. Now, i can see it from designers side. So, my idea is finishing couple courses, including Burea Design School.
